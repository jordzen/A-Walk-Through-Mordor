# **A Walk Through Mordor**

## **Site Overview**

A walk through Mordor is a game of chance, featuring four stages of face-down cards, with one being the correct choice, allowing you to move to the next stage. Each stage adds a card, making the chance of progressing harder. The design of the cards and the game is based on JRR Tolkens - The Lord Of The Rings. The idea is that the player starts by entering Mordor and as they progress through the stages they get closer to Mount Doom, where they will destroy the ring of power they carry. 
If they player selects a wrong card, they dont lose the game straight away. There is a pop up that apears, showing a randomly selected enemy and a required dice roll of a D20 dice. The player then rolls the dice and if they get a higher number than required, they get another chance to select the correct card and progress. If they roll under the required number, they lose. The game is won when the player finds the correct card on the final stage.
